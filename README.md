# DL-2020

This is a repository created for the course Deep Learning. It is a place where students can ask for help with the projects or ask general questions to the TAs.

Questions should be posted in the *issues* section. We use this approach so that anyone can benefit from an answered question. Before placing a new *issue*, please check that your problem is not already solved.

Additionally, we will try to provide you with some useful tutorials and sample code that might help you with your projects, specially if this is your first time using deep learning frameworks.

## Info about practicals

There will be 2 practicals. The first practical will be done in groups of 2 students and counts for 35% of the practical grade. The second practical will be done in groups of 4 (not more or less) students and will count for 65% of the final practical grade.

In the first practical each group (of 2 students) will choose an image dataset and examine the performance of different settings, such as:

* Comparison of Deep architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception V-3, ResNet, etc.
* Using dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, etc.
* Using different activation functions such as ReLU, ELU, Leaky ReLU, PReLU, SoftPlus, Sigmoid, etc.
* Using pre-trained networks, data augmentation
* Using different optimizers such as SGD, SGD with momentum, Adam, RMSProp, Nadam, etc.

Each group can do as many comparison studies as they want and write a report with a short description and tables / figures with results. The final report should be at most 3 pages in length. It is advised to not use a very large dataset (e.g. > 200,000 examples), as this would cost too much computational time.

For your report, you need to use the style-file which can be downloaded from: https://bnaic2014.org/?page_id=49

The deadline for mailing your report to m.a.wiering@rug.nl and (a link to) your code is: 28 February 2020, 23.59h

The report should consist of the following items: Title, student names + numbers, short intro, description of dataset, explanation of which methods you compared, results in a table (it is expected that there will be at least 8 different results), and a short discussion about the results.

For the second practical, groups (of 4 students) will work together to create their own system for another task such as:

1) Object detection or semantic segmentation
2) Time-series modelling with recurrent neural networks or Convolutional Neural Netwotks
3) Image generation with Generative Adversarial Networks or Variational AutoEncoders
4) Text generation
5) Deep reinforcement learning
6) Speech recognition
7) Natural language processing with deep models
8) Similar topics or ask the lecturer Marco Wiering

For the second practical, you need to send a proposal of 1 page before 20 February 2020, 23.59h with the following information: informative title, names + stud. numbers of 4 group members, programming environment (e.g. Keras), short description of the project, datasets / simulator used. At the end, the group writes a report and presents their research.

## How to raise issues

You can check all the solved questions and ask new ones [here](https://github.com/RUG-DeepLearning/DL-2020/issues)

To create a new issue, just click on the green *New issue* button at the right, write a short and identifiable question title, and then elaborate your problem(s) below.

If we see that a problem has been succefully solved we might close the issue. You can still view closed issues by filtering the issues by *Closed*, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/RUG-DeepLearning/DL-2020/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

If for some reason you can't raise an issue or you'd prefer not to make it public, you can always contact us by email.
