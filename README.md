# DL-2020

This is a repository created for the Deep Learning course of period 2A, 2020. Questions should be posted here as issues so that any of the TA's are be able to answer them, and all the students can benefit from a solved question.

## Info about practicals

There will be 2 practicals. The first practical will be done in groups of 2 students and counts for 35% of the practical grade. The second practical will be done in groups of 4 (not more or less) students and will count for 65% of the final practical grade.

In the first practical each group (of 2 students) will choose an image dataset and examine the performance of different settings, such as:

* Comparison of Deep architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception V-3, ResNet, etc.
* Using dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, etc.
* Using different activation functions such as ReLU, ELU, Leaky ReLU, PReLU, SoftPlus, Sigmoid, etc.
* Using pre-trained networks, data augmentation
* Using different optimizers such as SGD, SGD with momentum, Adam, RMSProp, Nadam, etc.

Each group can do as many comparison studies as they want and write a report with a short description and tables / figures with results. The final report should be at most 3 pages in length. It is advised to not use a very large dataset (e.g. > 200,000 examples), as this would cost too much computational time.

For your report, you need to use the style-file which can be downloaded from: https://bnaic2014.org/?page_id=49

The deadline for mailing your report to m.a.wiering@rug.nl and (a link to) your code is: 28 February 2020, 23.59h

The report should consist of the following items: Title, student names + numbers, short intro, description of dataset, explanation of which methods you compared, results in a table (it is expected that there will be at least 8 different results), and a short discussion about the results.

For the second practical, groups (of 4 students) will work together to create their own system for another task such as:

1) Object detection or semantic segmentation
2) Time-series modelling with recurrent neural networks or Convolutional Neural Netwotks
3) Image generation with Generative Adversarial Networks or Variational AutoEncoders
4) Text generation
5) Deep reinforcement learning
6) Speech recognition
7) Natural language processing with deep models
8) Similar topics or ask the lecturer Marco Wiering

For the second practical, you need to send a proposal of 1 page before 20 February 2020, 23.59h with the following information: informative title, names + stud. numbers of 4 group members, programming environment (e.g. Keras), short description of the project, datasets / simulator used. At the end, the group writes a report and presents their research.
