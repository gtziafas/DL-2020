    "# Sequence Processing with Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "#### Created by: Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Utrecht University, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "For tasks involving large linguistic units such as phrases, sentences and dialogues, we need machinery capable of processing _sequences_ or _structures_ of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks are an example of such machinery; for this assignment, you will construct a recurrent neural network that annotates each word of a sentence with a linguistically informative marker. In the simple case (and in this assignment), these markers will be POS tags. However, they can also be morphosyntactic informative [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_categorial_grammar) (supertags).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the task is a case of sequence labeling.  A good reference point is Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 9](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/9.pdf). For a fuller view of the picture, a good reference point is Alex Graves' [dissertation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a gradual approach, first inspecting recurrent neural networks, then moving on to data processing using high-grade word vectors before finally moving to the problem at hand. "

    "## Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks are a particularly interesting class of neural networks. Unlike standard fully-connected networks, which accept a fixed-size input and produce a fixed-size output over a predefined number of computational steps (i.e. network layers), RNNs instead operate on sequences of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, feedforward networks may be seen as a trainable (but parametrically fixed) function, whereas RNNs act as continuous, stateful programs operating on sequences of inputs. \n",
    "Cognitively, this may be viewed as enhancing our system's perceptive and computational abilities with a notion of memory.\n",
    "In the general case, this statefulness is captured by an intermediate hidden vector which is adjusted throughout the computation, affected by both the immediately previous version of itself __and__ the current input.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are nowadays established as the core machinery of neural sequence processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple recurrent network (SRN or Elman network) is described by the equations:\n",
    "* $h_t = \\theta_h (W_h x_t + U_h h_{t-1} + b_h ) $\n",
    "* $y_t = \\theta_y (W_y h_t + b_y) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where (at timestep $t$) $x_t$, $h_t$, $y_t$ are the network's input, hidden and output representations respectively, $\\theta_h$, $\\theta_y$ its hidden and output activation functions, and $W_h$, $U_h$, $b_h$, $W_y$, $b_y$ parametric tensors to be learned."
